## Assignment 1

I was trying to write a [simple page](http://jsbin.com/malibayoha/edit?html,js,output) to display information about a GitHub user. However, I hit a snag when attempting to make an Ajax request to the GitHub API to request for the data. The situation is decidedly weird because I can see the network request going out and coming back in the Network panel of the developer tools, and yet, the data variable does not come back populated - instead it is undefined. Luckily, I have access to [another program](http://jsbin.com/dojiwugoma/edit?js,output) I've written previously, which still works. Help me get to the bottom of this by using the *Bug Sandwich* technique.

## Assignment 2

In your work or studies, whenever you encounter a situation where something is broken but you know of a situation where it has worked before, employ the *Bug Sandwich* technique. More specifically, if

1. You have another app that works correctly.
2. You are following a code tutorial that has runnable code.
3. You have a broken feature that you know used to work before.
4. You have something that works in development but not in production or another environment.

Then that is a good candidate for using this technique. Take note of when and how this technique has been helpful. Report your findings.
