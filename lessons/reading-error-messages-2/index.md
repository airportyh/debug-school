What is a *stack trace*? You've probably seen it before. It's looks like a big wall of inscrutable text with file paths and line numbers. It usually shows up whenever you encounter an error of some sort. Chances are, you have avoided or ignored it before. This lesson will teach you what a stack trace is, how it comes about, why it is useful for debugging, and how to make the most of the information it provides.
