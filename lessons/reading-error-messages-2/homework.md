### Assignment 1

Take a small program that you have previously written - it can be the same program you used in the homework for [Part I](/lesson/3/reading-error-messages-1/play). You will

1. Introduce a runtime error.
2. Navigate down the stack trace. For each stack frame in the stack trace:
  1. Find the source code location in your code editor.
  2. Reason about the code and come up with an explanation as to what is happening here. If you don't know, come up with an educated guess.

### Assignment 2

The next time you encounter a big scary stacktrace, take a step back, breath deeply, and investigate the causal chain of events that were recorded by the stacktrace. Did you learn anything by doing this? Report back your findings.
