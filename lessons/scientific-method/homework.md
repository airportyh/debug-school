## Assignment 1

I have a [wordify program](http://jsbin.com/pacazagoya/edit?js,output) whose job is to take a numerical number and say it in English. For example, given the number `18`, it should return the string `eighteen`. This program has a bug in it, in that it returns the wrong result in some cases. For example, as [the code](http://jsbin.com/pacazagoya/edit?js,output) demonstrates, given the number `26`, it actually returns `thirty six`. Use the *Scientific Method* to investigate and then fix this problem. Use a note book to keep track of the

* Question
* Hypothesis
* Prediction
* Experiment
* Analysis

you used in each step.

## Assignment 2

Whenever you encounter a bug in your word or in your studies, explicitly use the *Scientific Method* to solve it. Take note of whether or how this technique is helpful to you. Report your findings.
