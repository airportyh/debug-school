You are coding in deep concentration. Everything is going well. You are feeling great. Then it happens: a peculiar error message that's entirely unexpected. "Ack!" you shrieked. Not wanting the good times to end, you frantically try to undo the last thing modified, rather than reading the error message to understand what happened.

Computer error messages are not the most human friendly texts you can come across. In fact, if you come into programming from a user's perspective, most of the errors you encounter are so impenatrable that you are conditioned to think that computer errors are things that you simply can do nothing about. But it doesn't have to be that way. The lesson will teach you to read error messages so you won't be afraid of them ever again.
