### Assignment 1

Take a small program that you have previously written, in any programming language - it doesn't matter, and try to see how many different ways you can break it by introducing different typos, deleting code from it, or even swapping lines in it. Read out loud each error message you generate, determine whether it is a runtime or syntax error, find the error location in your code editor, and then figure out and give an explanation for why the error message occurred. 

***Bonus***: Use one of the following tools to randomly insert typos into your program, and then try to debug the error:

* [tupo](https://github.com/airportyh/tupo) - use this if your program is written in JavaScript
* [Add A Typo](https://github.com/airportyh/add-a-typo) - use this if your program is written in a language other than JavaScript

### Assignment 2

Whenever you encounter an error message at work or in your studies, read the error message by following the steps laid out in this lesson. Take note of whether and how this practice helps you in your work. Report back your findings.
