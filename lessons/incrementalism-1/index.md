You typed out your code. You reviewed it multiple times to make sure you didn't forget something important. Moment of truth. You hit the "run" button. Error. You try something to fix the error. Error - a different one this time. You try something else. *Still* error. You feel like you've hit a brick wall. Ouch!

Chances are, you have been in situations like this. Rejoice, because this lesson will teach you the antidote: rather than writing an entire program from start to finish, do it in small incremental steps. This technique is what I call *incrementalism*.
