### Assignment 1

Using the programming language/environment of your choice, write a program that will read a text file from the file system and output into the terminal the number of lines the file contains. Take smaller steps than you normally would - use incrementalism. Write the same program multiple times using different step sizes - delete or rename the previous solution so that you can start over again.

### Assignment 2

Apply the concept of incrementalism at work or in a project within your normal studies. Take note of whether and how this technique helps you with your work. Report back your findings.
