      <h1>What's the #1 Most Painful Thing About Coding?</h1>
      <p><em>Getting stuck!</em></p>

      <p>Have you ever banged your head against the keyboard for
      hours feeling like you are wasting your life away?
      Have you ever furiously googled for the solution to your
      immediate problem and tried executing any code snippet on the
      internet that could potentially be a quick fix?
      Have you ever littered your code with copious log statements
      and then to comb through the output line by line to try to figure
      out what is going on. Have you ever to asked your question on
      StackOverflow and IRC chat rooms, and felt helpless when the
      internet fails to be of help? Does any of these sound familiar?</p>

      <p>Getting stuck can be frustrating, and because of this,
      the word "debugging" is often associated with unpleasant thoughts,
      but it doesn't have to be this way. Debugging is simply a
      know-how to be learned, a skill to be honed, a practice to
      be mastered.</p>

      <h1>Enter Debug School</h1>

      <p>You can learn time-tested debugging techniques from Debug
      School, and once you do, you will face bugs with optimism,
      not fear. When you encounter a difficult problem, you are
      intrigued, not discouraged. You feel in control of the programs
      you write. You feel free to experiment with different ideas.
      You find optimal solutions to problems and you don't go for
      duck-tape solutions. You will learn new things more quickly.
      Coding will be fun again!</p>

      <p>
        Debug School is a series of 6 lessons that will teach you
        battle-tested debugging and troubleshooting techniques.
        Luckily for you, the author of Debug School has decided to
